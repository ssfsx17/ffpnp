# Trappings

1. [Weapons](Weapons.md)
2. [Armor](Armor.md)
3. [Jewelry](Jewelry.md)
4. [Accessories](Accessories.md)
5. [Items](Items.md)
6. [Animals, Equipment, and Services](Misc.md)

All trappings have an Item Level. Trappings above Item Level 99 are impossible to buy or sell, but they might still exist if the GM plants them somewhere in the game world.

If the GM wishes to have challenge sidequests with bosses who are many times harder than the actual story boss, then such priceless equipment should in fact be a requirement to finish these sidequests. The process of finding the priceless equipment would itself be a large set of sidequests.
