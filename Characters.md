# Characters

## Character Creation Procedure

1. Write the Three Things about your character.
2. Choose your character's race.
3. Allocate 100 attribute points. No attribute may be more than double the lowest one.
4. Start with Job Level 1 in all base jobs: [Chemist](/Jobs/Chemist.md), [Freelancer](/Jobs/Freelancer.md), [Onion Knight](/Jobs/OnionKnight.md), and [Squire](/Jobs/Squire.md).
5. Start with 200 gil.

## Three Things

Write three distinctive things about your character. These should indicate your character's motives and personality, serving as pillars for improvised acting. They can be changed later, especially if events in the game cause them to no longer be true.

Examples:

- "His home was invaded by the Empire."
- "Fell in a cave and heard a voice telling him to save the world."
- "Doubts the motives of his king."
- "Woman who dresses as a man to maintain the respect of her peers. Such is the environment she survives in."
- "Enslaved by an insane magical clown, until a traumatic event freed her."
- "He is actually a remote-controlled robot. Apparently the creator put all his sense of humor and fun into it."
- "Sometimes falls too much in love with her students, even though she is older and taller than them. They are totally 18 or older though."
- "Her home environment was far too stifling and controlling, so she escaped."
- "She is the ex-secretary of the evil empire."
- "He willingly took the blame for the assassination of the king, believing this would avert an even worse war. The real assassin was someone close to him."

## Attributes

Characters start with 100 attribute points, and gain 5 at every level after the first.

No attribute can have more than double the number of points allocated to it than any other. This includes the points gained by experience levels. Support abilities and status effects do not count towards this restriction.

- Strength - melee power, ranged power for some weapons
- Agility - ranged power for some weapons, physical accuracy, physical evasion
- Vitality - HP, physical defense
- Intellect - magic power, magic evasion
- Spirit - MP, magic defense
- Speed - initiative, AP charge

## Statistics

Maximum HP = Vitality * Level

- For Player-Characters, Maximum HP cannot exceed 9,999.

Maximum MP = Spirit * Level * 0.1

- For Player-Characters, Maximum MP cannot exceed 999.

Accuracy = Agility

Evasion = Agility

Defense = Vitality

Magic Accuracy = Intellect

Magic Evasion = Intellect

Magic Defense = Spirit

It helps to keep track of these numbers at all times:

- Strength * Level
- Agility * Level
- Vitality * Level
- Intellect * Level
- Spirit * Level
- Speed * Level

## Equipment

Characters have the following equipment slots:

- Right Hand
- Left Hand
- Head
- Body
- Arms
- Legs
- Accessory

## Experience Levels

When characters gain a level, they also gain 5 attribute points. They must still follow the rule that no attribute can be more than double any other.

XP required to gain a level = previous requirement + (Previous Level * 1000)
