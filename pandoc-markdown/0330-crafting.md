## Crafting

In FFP&P, crafting, maintenance, desynthesizing, etc. are all mashed together as just deciding what crafted items you maintain the existence of. You also do not have to maintain your starting equipment, although that is always at Item Level 1.

Maximum Item Level for items you craft is equal to whichever is lower from your Experience Level and relevant Job Level.

**Example:** You have an Experience Level of 20, and an Armorer Job Level of 15. In this case, the maximum Item Level you can craft for armor is 15.

Item Level reserves from the combined pool of Gathering & Craftsmanship

**High-Quality** items then reserve their Item Level from both Perception & Control separately. Therefore, on average, only half of your crafted items can be High-Quality. Such items function as if they were 5 Item Levels higher.

**Example:** You have a crafted item of Item Level 30. You can reserve 30 Gathering, 30 Craftsmanship, 15 Gathering and 15 Craftsmanship, or other combination. If you want to craft it as High-Quality, then you must additionally reserve both 30 Perception and 30 Control.

The same item can be crafted multiple times. Each time after the first reserves half as much of your crafting stats.

**Example:** You have crafted 7 items of the same type, of Item Level 20. This reserves 80 from your Gathering & Craftsmanship pool. If you want them all to be crafted at High-Quality then this additionally reserves 80 Perception and 80 Control.
