# Espers

Also known as Summoned Beasts, Eidolons, Eikons and Primals. You must form a Pact with an Esper in order to be able to perform any of the listed actions.

- **Dominant Form** - Allowing the Esper to temporarily displace yourself in the current plane of existence to act as a powerful creature. This lasts for six status phases. Also capable of performing the _Esper Action_, _Evocation Magick_ and _Summoning Magick_ for the duration, depending on your Job Levels. The costs are taken from the one who is maintaining the _Dominant Form_, rather than from the Esper. Requires [Dominant] Job Levels.
- **Egi-Form** - Miniature and weakened version of the Esper, usable as a persistent companion. The Egi-Form is capable of performing the associated _Esper Action_. Requires [Arcanist] Job Levels.
- **Esper Action** - Can only be used by the _Dominant Form_ and _Egi-Form_ of the Esper. Requires [Arcanist] or [Dominant] Job Levels, whichever is higher.
- **Evocation Magick** - Evoking the personality of the Esper to produce a wide variety of effects. Requires [Evoker] Job Levels.
- **Summoning Magick** - Summoning the Esper to come forth into your current plane of existence in order to do a powerful action. Requires [Summoner] Job Levels.
