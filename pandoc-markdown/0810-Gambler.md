- **Action: Gambling:** Games of betting, luck and chance for questionable rewards. The potential gains are great, but you can also lose everything. The game group is not obligated to wait for full Gambling actions to play out, because some of them can take a considerable amount of time (especially _Chess With Death_). Also beware that some may involve real money (e.g. _Gachapon Capsule_).

**Mastery Bonus:** When you do an action with a random element in it other than critical hit chance, you can reroll that random element. You choose which of the two results to stick with. If used with _Gambling_ actions, then a full action is treated as a single random element, e.g. a full play of slots or a full hand of mahjong.
