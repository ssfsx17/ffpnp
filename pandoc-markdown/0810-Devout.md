- **Action: Pray:** Choose an HP-restoring action. You attempt to perform that action at no cost, on the whole party. If it has both a single-target and multi-target version, then it is performed at single-target strength, except on the whole party. The percentage chance of success is equal to the difference between the Job Level required to do that action, and your Devout Job Level.
- **Reaction: Mana Shield (100 TP):** Half of After-Armor damage you receive is taken from MP rather than HP. If you run out of MP then remaining damage is applied to your HP.
