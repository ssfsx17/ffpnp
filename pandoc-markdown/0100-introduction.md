# Introduction

## What is Final Fantasy?

Final Fantasy is a massive franchise owned by Square-Enix Ltd. It started out as a video game derivative of Dungeons & Dragons, with four Warriors of Light fighting against Chaos in order to save the world. It has since developed and encompassed just about every possible hero-saves-the-world plot possible. Each full Final Fantasy game is its own universe, such that there is no plotline continuity between games, although there are numerous common trappings and other elements. Some games have become franchises in themselves with their own sequels, with the biggest sub-franchise being Final Fantasy VII, and the highest-budget sub-franchise being Final Fantasy XV.

If FF P&P is your first encounter with this grand multiverse, worry not. Start with what you have in front of you. Get adjusted to your gaming group, and adapt to the setting that is put forth by your Game Master.

## Not All About Combat

The term "role-playing game" is often interpreted to mean a game of combat. Some time must be spent managing numbers in order to fare better at combat, as opposed to being purely about skill within the combat situations. Many of them happen to be about knights and soldiers, who then proceed to engage in a lot of combat as befits their jobs.

But in reality, role-playing games are about playing any kind of role. Imagine a game where one person pretends to be an average person on the street, and the other person pretends to be a salesman giving a pitch - that is just as much of a role-playing game.

## Improvised Acting

Role-playing games are more fun when you are able to get into your role and explore what it is like to be someone else. Although there can be a considerable number of rules, they do not determine what situations you will actually face. You must endure all sorts of things never seen before, things conjured by the imagination of others, and react just as your role would.

## True Choices & Consequences

Video games must have all their choices & consequences pre-written. Even when attempting procedural generation, the possibile traits must still be pre-written.

With role-playing games, however, anything can happen. True consequences and reactivity are possible, since you are dealing with other people playing their roles, rather than with some pre-built system. If you have played your role as a pure paragon, then you can ensure that the ending of the game reflects this, and possibly even convince your enemies that they are wrong and ought to cease their harmful actions. Likewise, if you have played your role as a pure renegade, then perhaps there is a way to destroy your bitter enemy through your own ingenuity, rather than resorting to contrived plot devices. You do not have to accept that the game simply ends with one of three choices, each of which causes different-colored explosions.

## All Rules are Optional

Each group of people finds that different rules suit their needs and personalities the best. It is natural, and even encouraged, that each gaming group would therefore add, remove, and change rules.

Any changes that are considered to be just plain better, rather than a matter of taste, should be discussed on the official Discord. If there is great favor towards the changes, then they will be adopted as official.

## Differences to other Final Fantasy-inspired Pen & Paper Games:

This is not the first attempt to write a role-playing game based on the Final Fantasy franchise, nor will it be the last. In fact it is quite good for hobbyist scenes when more people get into them and make their own take, so that everyone in the scene can learn from each other and change their own ideas of perfection. Considering how large the franchise is, it would be more worrying if people somehow did *not* have varying opinions.

The key points of difference are listed below:

- The number scale of the Final Fantasy video games, rather than the Seiken Densetsu or Chrono Trigger games. Why settle for 999 HP when you can have 99,999 HP! This does, however, cause removal of dice rolling in most other aspects of the game.
- The Job system is taken primarily from games that have changeable jobs and dresspheres. This means there will be weaker starting jobs and stronger unlockable jobs. The late game purposely involves powerful combinations of abilities.
- No skill system. Instead, relevant Job levels are used for skill checks.
- Maximalist approach. Inclusion of jobs and abilities is preferred compared to exclusion.
