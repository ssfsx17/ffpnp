| Cost         | Mapless  | Map             |
| ---          | ---      | ---             |
| TP: Variable | Variable | Ranged Indirect |
|              |          | Variable        |

You use one **Geometric Dimension** and one **Numerological Pattern** to cast a Magick spell. You must currently have that spell available through one of your current Action choices. If it has both a single-target and multi-target form, then you use the single-target form, except its targeting is according to _Calculate_.

**Geometric Dimension: Initiative**

| Cost    |
| ---     |
| TP: 100 |

Target all on the battlefield whose Initiative fits the Numerological Pattern.

**Numerological Pattern: Primes**

| Cost    |
| ---     |
| TP: 101 |

Target all on the battlefield whose Geometric Dimension is a prime number greater than 1.

#### Arithmetician 10

**Geometric Dimension: Experience Level**
