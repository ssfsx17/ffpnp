# Rules

## Short Rests and Long Rests

Short rests are any kind of rest that can be had outside of a time-sensitive situation. As long as you are not being chased, chasing someone else, in the middle of driving, or any other such scenario, you can probably fit in a short rest.

Long rests take long enough to potentially result in long-term problems. They have been classically defined as 8-hour sleeps or breaks, but could be longer or shorter according to the story's stakes.

Both types of rest set your current TP to 0.

## Rewards Per Game Session

One, two or three Experience Levels are given for every game session, depending on the pace of game that is desired.

For each Experience Level gained, characters also receive:

- 100 battle attribute points
- Flexible Job Points equal to new Experience Level * 10. For example, a Level 1 character advancing to Level 2 will gain 20 JP. A Level 25 character advancing to Level 26 will gain 260 JP.

Once the maximum Experience Level is reached, further Game Sessions give a reward of 1,000 JP each.

An alternate way to view this is to determine your current Battle Attribute Points and flexible Job Points based solely on your Experience Level:

## Levelling Jobs

The cost to learn a new Job is 100 JP. Different game groups may have additional requirements, such as needing to learn from a specific Job Trainer, or needing to find Job Crystals.

The cost to improve a Job Level is equal to its current Job Level - for example, it costs 1 JP to improve from Job Level 1 to 2. It costs 55 JP to improve from Job Level 55 to 56.

An alternate way to view this is to calculate Job Level in terms of the total amount of JP spent on the job:

| Job Level | JP Spent | Job Level | JP Spent |
| ---       | ---      | ---       | ---      |
| **1**     | 100      | **51**    | 1375     |
| **2**     | 101      | **52**    | 1426     |
| **3**     | 103      | **53**    | 1478     |

Using this view - If you have spent 1,000 JP on a Job, then it is at Job Level 42. If you have spent 2,000 JP on a Job, then it is at Job Level 62. The [Chemist], [Freelancer] and [Squire] Jobs as well as chosen Civilian Jobs would implicitly have at least 100 JP spent on each of them to begin with. Any jobs starting at Job Level 10 would implicitly start with 145 JP spent on them.

## Learning New Jobs

The first Job Level of any Job can be learned for 100 JP, if you meet the requirements.

Game groups can add more restrictions on learning new Jobs depending on their game world:

- A set of Jobs may be sealed within the Wind Crystal of the world, and cannot be learned until the player team journeys to that crystal and defeats its guardian.
- Every single job may be sealed within its own unique Dress Sphere. Consequently, each Dress Sphere must be discovered.
- Jobs may be sealed behind a formal training procedure. Each Job Trainer lives in a different major city, and the player team must study under such Job Trainers for a period of time before gaining their first Job Levels.

Whichever restrictions are chosen for learning new Jobs, they must be used consistently for the whole group in perpetuity, as mixing methods will inflict severe inequality.

## Changing Jobs

You can change your current Job during a Long Rest.

Game groups may choose to add additional methods of changing Jobs which make sense for their game world:

- Jobs are socketed into special Job grids. Job grids must be equipped. Characters have an additional action in combat to change their Job, but it must always be a change from their current one to a linked one on their currently-equipped grid.
- Jobs can be changed at any time, except during dramatic situations and combat.
- Jobs are determined entirely by your current weapon. Therefore, you can change jobs simply by changing your weapon, but this could potentially result in de-equipping all of your armor instantly, and therefore is inadvisable during combat.

Whichever methods of changing Jobs are chosen, they must be used consistently for the whole game group.

## Skill Chances

Skill Chance = The sum of all relevant Job Levels. If your current Job is relevant then your Skill is a minimum of 50.

Use two ten-sided dice. Choose one die to be the tens place, and the other die to be the ones place. It is recommended that the two dice are different colors, or that one of them has explicit multiples-of-ten markings. Roll the dice. A roll with 10 on both dice is considered 100.

Failure does not halt progress. Instead, it means a disadvantageous path to progress.

**Example:** The Player-Characters are examining a scene for clues about what really happened. Several of the Player-Characters are not currently using relevant Jobs, so their chances to get clues are low. They have a variety of options to get clues via other means:

- Need to get more information from a shady broker. This then results in difficult sidequests.
- Spend extra time to gather clues. But this gives the enemy enough time to bring a hit squad to the scene, who the party must then fight.
- One of the characters must remember a painful and traumatic event, because that event was similar to the current scene under examination. They must literally fight against an enemy, solo, within their flashback.

**Example:** The Player-Characters are running away from an overwhelming enemy force. One of the Player-Characters fails their Skill check. That character has a variety of options that do not halt the story, but are certainly challenging:

- Captured, has to fight solo through the enemy prison, but has an opportunity to steal some key documents on the way out.
- Falls into a hole in the ground, has to fight solo through some special sewer enemies, but rejoins the rest of the party at the end.
- The party stops to help the lost character. As a consequence, the enemy is able to bring out a powerful and challenging boss.
