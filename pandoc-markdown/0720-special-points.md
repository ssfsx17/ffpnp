## Special Points

### Auto-Cure Points

Upon taking damage, if you are still alive, then Auto-Cure Points are spent to restore your HP.

### Doom Points

When you have 4 Doom Points, you die and lose all Doom Points.

Plot Armor Enemies instead take an amount of damage equal to 10% of their maximum HP, then end _Doom_ status.

### Enmity

For the purposes of random enemy targeting, you are considered an additional number of targets equal to your Enmity Points. For example, if you have 5 Enmity Points, then you are considered 6 targets. You lose one Enmity Point during the Status Phase.

In map combat, you are also considered a number of squares closer to the enemy equal to your Enmity Points, compared to your party members. This could possibly cause an enemy to disengage from a party member who is only a few squares away to chase you instead.

In mapless combat, if you are not in the front row, then you lose four Enmity Points during the Status Phase instead.

### Fish Counter

Used for [Festivalist] fish abilities. Adding more fish to a target results in relevant abilities doing more damage to that target.

### Shield Points

Damage is taken from your Shield Points before your HP. During the Status Phase, your Shield Points are halved.
