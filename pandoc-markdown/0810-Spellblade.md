- **Reaction: Magic Shell (250 TP):** Upon taking magical damage, gain [Shell][Status: Shell] status.
- **Support: Memento:** If you die, then your remaining MP is divided evenly amongst all surviving allies.
- **Support: Blood Price:** You can choose to transform MP costs into double HP costs.
- **Support: Auto Aspir Saber:** You start every battle with _Aspir Saber_ active, even if you do not have _Weapon Magick_.
