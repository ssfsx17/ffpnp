### Dominant Form

Refer to [Espers] for the details on the possible Dominant Forms and their stats. You must have a pact with an Esper in order to use its Dominant Form. The form lasts for 6 status phases. While in a Dominant Form, you can perform the associated _Esper Action_, _Evocation Magick_ and _Summoning Magick_. The costs of such actions are taken from yourself rather than from the Esper.
