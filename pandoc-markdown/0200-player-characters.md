## Three Things

Write three things that make your character unique. They can encompass personal history, relation to the world, physical appearance, or anything else that sets your character apart.

Examples of things to write about your character:

- "He washed up on a beach with no memories."
- "Her home was invaded by the Evil Empire, and her brother went missing."
- "He fell into a cave and heard a voice telling him to save the world."
- "He doubts the motives of his king."
- "She is a woman who dresses as a man to maintain the respect of her peers. Such is the environment she survives in."
- "She was enslaved by an insane magical clown, until a traumatic event freed her."
- "The last thing he remembers is being a member of an elite organization and trying to stop an insane sword-wielding maniac."
- "She guards the princess with her life, as is her ordained duty."
- "After a failed relationship, she decides to see if her ex-boyfriend's rival is a decent man."
- "Her home environment was far too stifling and controlling, so she escaped."
- "He was attacked by a flying gigantic creature that sent him into another world."
- "She got fed up with lacking a [White Mage] for her party, so she decided to learn how to become one."
- "He willingly took the blame for the assassination of the king, believing this would avert an even worse war. The real assassin was someone close to him."
- "Her sister was kidnapped for some purpose known only to the gods."
- "She heard the soul of the planet calling out to her to hear, feel, and think."
- "He is the heir to the throne, yet the evil empire threatens to destroy his homeland."

## Experience Level

Experience Level (LVL) is a significant factor in many calculations. As a general rule, Player Characters gain one, two or three Experience Levels (LVL) per game session, depending on the pace desired by the group.

## Battle Attributes

| Battle Attribute  | Explanation |
| ---               | ---         |
| **Strength**      | damage for most melee weapons, helps reduce equipment weight
| **Dexterity**     | damage for some weapons, physical accuracy
| **Agility**       | physical evasion
| **Speed**         | initiative
| **Vitality**      | maximum HP
| **Stamina**       | HP regen from Charge Up actions, inherent physical armor
| **Intellect**     | magical damage, magical accuracy
| **Wisdom**        | healing power
| **Mind**          | maximum MP, magical evasion
| **Spirit**        | MP regen from Charge Up actions, inherent magical armor
| **Tenacity**      | maximum TP
| **Determination** | TP charge from Charge Up actions, as well as passive TP gain

You start with 100 Battle Attribute Points, and gain 100 more with each Experience Level. Thus, your total number of Battle Attribute Points will be equal to Experience Level * 100.

No one battle attribute can have more than triple the number of points as another battle attribute. For example, if you have allocated 900 points to Strength, then all your other battle attributes must have at least 300 points allocated to them.

## Statistics

| Civil Stats    | Explanation |
| ---            | ---         |
| Gathering      | Reserved by crafting items, increased through Job Levels in Disciples of the Land
| Perception     | Reserved by crafting High-Quality items, increased through Job Levels in Disciples of the Land
| Craftsmanship  | Reserved by crafting items, increased through Job Levels in Disciples of the Hand
| Control        | Reserved by crafting High-Quality items, increased through Job Levels in Disciples of the Hand

| Combat Stats                  | Formula                     | Explanation |
| ---                           | ---                         | ---         |
| **Health Points (HP)**        | 100 + (LVL * Vitality)      | How much punishment you can take before dying. When your current HP reaches 0 or less, you are dead.
| **Magic Points (MP)**         | 100 + (LVL * Mind)          | How much magical energy you have for performing various magical techniques. If you die, your current MP are also sent to zero.
| **Technique Points (TP)**     | 100 + (LVL * Tenacity)      | How much battle technique energy you can hold during combat. After any amount of rest, your current TP are sent to zero. If you die, your current TP are also sent to zero.
| **Physical Accuracy (P-Acc)** | LVL + Dexterity             | Your skill at performing physical attacks. If your P-Acc is high enough then you will have a chance of performing Critical Hits. If your P-Acc is too low then you will perform Glancing Hits, or even start missing.
| **Physical Evasion (P-Eva)**  | LVL + Agility               | Your skill at avoiding physical attacks. If your P-Eva is high enough then you will receive Glancing Hits instead of Direct Hits, or even avoid attacks entirely. If your P-Eva is too low then you will have a chance of receiving Critical Hits.
| **Physical Defense (P-Def)**  | 10 + (LVL * Vitality * 0.1) | Resistance to physical damage. If your P-Def is high enough then your HP will go quite far.
| **Magical Accuracy (M-Acc)**  | LVL + Intellect          | Your skill at aiming magical attacks. If your P-Acc is high enough then you will have a chance of performing Critical Hits. If your M-Acc is too low then you will perform Glancing Hits, or even start missing.
| **Magical Evasion (M-Eva)**   | LVL + Mind                  | Your skill at disappearing from magic attacks. If your M-Eva is high enough then you will receive Glancing Hits instead of Direct Hits, or even avoid attacks entirely. If your M-Eva is too low then you will have a chance of receiving Critical Hits.
| **Magical Defense (M-Def)**   | 10 + (LVL * Spirit * 0.1)   | Resistance to magical damage. If your M-Def is high enough then your HP will go quite far.
| **Weight Capacity** | LVL + Strength | In general, the more Weight you have above your capacity, the slower you act, and consequently the more susceptible to interruption.

## Initiative Roll

Initiative Roll = 1d100 + Experience Level + Speed - Excess Weight

If Excess Weight is too high then you will end up suffering from Charge Time on every single round.

## Jobs

Jobs are magical concepts that confer supernatural abilities to whoever wears them. They magically-alter your clothing and other superficial traits to fit. For example, if you change into the [Red Mage] Job, you will suddenly have a red feathered hat and cape.

### Starting Civilian Jobs

Choose two different Civilian Jobs to start at Job Level 20. All other Civilian Jobs are initially unlearned.

### Starting Combat Jobs

[Chemist], [Freelancer] and [Squire] start at Job Level 1. Then, choose either [Chemist] or [Squire] to start at Job Level 10 instead.

## Starting Items and Equipment

1 full set of gathering gear of Item Level 1

1 full set of crafting gear of Item Level 1

Your choice of combat job to start at Job Level 10 determines which of the following sets you get:

a. [Chemist] set = 1H Dagger and full set of Magic armor, all at Item Level 1
b. [Squire] set = 1H Sword and full set of War armor, all at Item Level 1

You do not need to maintain your starting items and equipment, but it is always at Item Level 1. Therefore you must start gathering and crafting, as well as cooperate with others, in order to have better stuff.

## Special Traits

All characters start with three Special Traits, and may potentially gain more, or change existing ones, according to the story.

**Awakening** - You have a number of rounds of Awakening energy equal to 1/10th of your Experience Level, rounded down, to a minimum of 1 round. You can spend an action to enter or cease Awakening. While in Awakening, your Strength, Vitality, and Agility are doubled. You refresh your Awakening energy after a Long Rest.

**Civilian Experience** - You start with ten different Civilian Jobs at Job Level 20, rather than two.

**Desperation Attack** - While your Current HP is less than one-fourth of your Maximum HP, your normal Attacks have a 10% chance to be a Desperation Attack instead. Desperation Attacks target all enemies, and are Direct Critical Hits.

**Job Training: Specific Job** - You start at Job Level 1 in one job of choice. You must meet its requirements to gain additional Job Levels in it. While wearing the [Freelancer] Job, you may have additional clothing and other superficial traits relating to your specially-trained job as well.

**Monster** - You can replace your body parts with those of defeated creatures. After every battle, you choose one part to put onto yourself. This part replaces one of your equipment slots, and in exchange, overrides one of your Battle Attributes with that creature's attribute number, or overrides one of your Statistics with that creature's statistic number. You can no longer wear equipment on that slot. You have access to one signature ability of that creature for each body part replaced.

**Morph** - You have a number of rounds of Morph energy equal to 1/10th of your Experience Level, rounded down, to a minimum of 1 round. You can spend an action to enter or cease Morph. While Morphed, your Strength, Intellect, and Spirit are doubled. You refresh your Morph energy after a long rest.

**Mystic** - One of your equipment slots is permanently replaced by a Mystic Body Part. You can bind up to three creatures to your Mystic Body Part, allowing you to tap into their Job experience or use their unique non-Job abilities. If binding a creature for its Job experience, then you specifically bind one of its Jobs, and gain access to the Job Level that the creature had. If binding a creature for its unique abilities, then you specifically bind one ability which you can then use at any time. In order to bind a creature, you must defeat it with a regular Attack action while also declaring that it is a Mystic Binding attempt.

**Robot** - Your Battle Attributes are halved. In exchange, your equipment increases your attributes, as follows:

| Equipment   | Robot Mod |
| ---         | ---       |
| Tool/Shield | Adds Weight to Agility & Mind
| Head        | Adds Weight to Wisdom & Spirit
| Body        | Adds Weight to Vitality & Stamina
| Arms        | Adds Weight to Dexterity & Tenacity
| Legs        | Adds Weight to Agility & Speed
| Feet        | Adds Weight to Mind & Speed
| Ears        | Adds Weight to Intellect & Determination
| Weapon      | Adds Weight * 2 to attribute of weapon's damage type

This is in addition to the other attribute & stat modifiers from equipment that would also affect non-robots.

**Two-Hour Ability** - Once per two hours, you can spend an action to activate your Two-Hour Ability. This cuts the MP and TP costs of actions from your current Job in half, for a duration of 4 status phases. This does not affect any other abilities you are capable of, only those from your current Job.

**Undead** - You permanently have [Zombie status][Status: Zombie]. In exchange, whenever you are defeated, you automatically pop up at 1 HP after 4 status phases.

## What Jobs Should I Aim For?

These paths are merely examples of the order in which to purchase Job Levels, which fit into typical combat roles. They are not necessarily the best for your current group, nor the best for your character's self actualization. Also keep in mind that, with enough playtime, it is possible to master every single Job in the game on one character.

Be aware that the party's need to craft gear and items may require you to spend JP on Civilian Jobs as well.
