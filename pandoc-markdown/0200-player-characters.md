## Three Things

## Experience Level

Experience Level (LVL) is a significant factor in many calculations. As a general rule, Player Characters gain one, two or three Experience Levels (LVL) per game session, depending on the pace desired by the group.

## Battle Attributes

| Battle Attribute  | Explanation |
| ---               | ---         |
| **Strength**      | damage for most melee weapons, helps reduce equipment weight
| **Dexterity**     | damage for some weapons, physical accuracy
| **Agility**       | physical evasion
| **Speed**         | initiative
| **Vitality**      | maximum HP
| **Stamina**       | HP regen from Charge Up actions, inherent physical armor
| **Intellect**     | magical damage, magical accuracy
| **Wisdom**        | healing power
| **Mind**          | maximum MP, magical evasion
| **Spirit**        | MP regen from Charge Up actions, inherent magical armor
| **Tenacity**      | maximum TP
| **Determination** | TP charge from Charge Up actions, as well as passive TP gain

You start with 100 Battle Attribute Points, and gain 100 more with each Experience Level. Thus, your total number of Battle Attribute Points will be equal to Experience Level * 100.

No one battle attribute can have more than triple the number of points as another battle attribute. For example, if you have allocated 900 points to Strength, then all your other battle attributes must have at least 300 points allocated to them.

## Statistics

| Civil Stats    | Explanation |

| Perception     | Reserved by crafting High-Quality items, increased through Job Levels in Disciples of the Land
| Craftsmanship  | Reserved by crafting items, increased through Job Levels in Disciples of the Hand

| Combat Stats                  | Formula                     | Explanation |
| ---                           | ---                         | ---         |
| **Health Points (HP)**        | 100 + (LVL * Vitality)      | How much punishment you can take before dying. When your current HP reaches 0, you are dead.
| **Magic Points (MP)**         | 100 + (LVL * Mind)          | How much magical energy you have for performing various magical techniques. If you die, your current MP are also sent to zero.
| **Technique Points (TP)**     | 100 + (LVL * Tenacity)      | How much battle technique energy you can hold during combat. After any amount of rest, your current TP are sent to zero. If you die, your current TP are also sent to zero.
| **Physical Accuracy (P-Acc)** | LVL + Dexterity             | Your skill at performing physical attacks. If your P-Acc is high enough then you will have a chance of performing Critical Hits. If your P-Acc is too low then you will perform Glancing Hits, or even start missing.
| **Physical Evasion (P-Eva)**  | LVL + Agility               | Your skill at avoiding physical attacks. If your P-Eva is high enough then you will receive Glancing Hits instead of Direct Hits, or even avoid attacks entirely. If your P-Eva is too low then you will have a chance of receiving Critical Hits.
| **Physical Defense (P-Def)**  | 10 + (LVL * Vitality * 0.1) | Resistance to physical damage. If your P-Def is high enough then your HP will go quite far.
| **Magical Accuracy (M-Acc)**  | LVL + Intellect          | Your skill at aiming magical attacks. If your P-Acc is high enough then you will have a chance of performing Critical Hits. If your M-Acc is too low then you will perform Glancing Hits, or even start missing.
| **Magical Evasion (M-Eva)**   | LVL + Mind                  | Your skill at disappearing from magic attacks. If your M-Eva is high enough then you will receive Glancing Hits instead of Direct Hits, or even avoid attacks entirely. If your M-Eva is too low then you will have a chance of receiving Critical Hits.
| **Magical Defense (M-Def)**   | 10 + (LVL * Spirit * 0.1)   | Resistance to magical damage. If your M-Def is high enough then your HP will go quite far.
| **Weight Capacity** | Strength | In general, the more Weight you have above your capacity, the slower you act, and consequently the more susceptible to interruption.

## Initiative Roll

Initiative Roll = 1d100 + Experience Level + Speed - Weight

Initiative is a minimum of zero, so if you have as little Speed as possible and as much Equipment Weight as possible, then you actually get some certainty about when you act in combat.

## Starting Civilian Jobs

Choose two different Civilian Jobs to start at Job Level 10. All other Civilian Jobs are initially unlearned.

## Starting Combat Jobs

[Chemist], [Freelancer] and [Squire] start at Job Level 1. Then, choose either [Chemist] or [Squire] to start at Job Level 10 instead.

## Starting Items and Equipment

1 full set of gathering gear of Item Level 1

1 full set of crafting gear of Item Level 1

Your choice of combat job to start at Job Level 10 determines which of the following sets you get:

- [Chemist] set
- [Squire] set

You do not need to maintain your starting items and equipment, but it is always at Item Level 1. Therefore you must start gathering and crafting, as well as cooperate with others, in order to have better stuff.

## Special Traits

All characters start with three Special Traits, and may potentially gain more, or change existing ones, according to the story.

**Awakening** - You have a number of rounds of Awakening energy equal to 1/10th of your Experience Level, rounded down, to a minimum of 1 round. You can spend an action to enter or cease Awakening. While in Awakening, your Strength, Vitality, and Agility are doubled. You refresh your Awakening energy after a Long Rest.

**Civilian Experience** - You start with all Civilian Jobs at Job Level 20.

**Desperation Attack** - While your Current HP is less than one-fourth of your Maximum HP, your normal Attacks have a 10% chance to be a Desperation Attack instead. Desperation Attacks target all enemies, and are Direct Critical Hits.

**Job Training: Specific Job** - You start at Job Level 1 in one job of choice. You must meet its requirements to gain additional Job Levels in it.

**Morph** - You have a number of rounds of Morph energy equal to 1/10th of your Experience Level, rounded down, to a minimum of 1 round. You can spend an action to enter or cease Morph. While Morphed, your Strength, Intellect, and Spirit are doubled. You refresh your Morph energy after a long rest.

**Mystic** - One of your equipment slots is permanently replaced by a Mystic Body Part. You can bind up to three creatures to your Mystic Body Part, allowing you to tap into their Job experience or use their unique non-Job abilities. If binding a creature for its Job experience, then you specifically bind one of its Jobs, and gain access to the Job Level that the creature had. If binding a creature for its unique abilities, then you specifically bind one ability which you can then use at any time. In order to bind a creature, you must defeat it with a regular Attack action while also declaring that it is a Mystic Binding attempt.

**Two-Hour Ability** - Once per two hours, you can spend an action to activate your Two-Hour Ability. This cuts the MP and TP costs of actions from your current Job in half, for a duration of 4 status phases. This does not affect any other abilities you are capable of, only those from your current Job.

**Undead** - You permanently have [Zombie status][Status: Zombie]. In exchange, whenever you are defeated, you automatically pop up at 1 HP after 4 status phases.

## Example Paths

These paths are merely examples of the order in which to purchase Job Levels, which fit into typical combat roles. They are not necessarily the best for your current group, nor the best for your character's self actualization. Also keep in mind that, with enough playtime, it is possible to master every single Job in the game on one character.
