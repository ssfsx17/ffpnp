- **Action: Mimic:** You perform the exact same action as your previous party member in the turn order. You ignore the Charge Time, Cast Time, MP and TP costs. But, all other costs such as item uses, Chakras, Lilies and Limit Breaks still apply.
  - If your previous ally in the turn order used a reach or ranged weapon, and you do not have such a weapon equipped, then you instead use whatever weapon you do have in the same relative direction.
  - In mapless combat, you perform the action on the exact same targets, if possible. Otherwise you perform the action on the closest valid targets.
  - In map combat, you also perform it in the same relative direction. For example, if your previous ally in the turn order performs a melee attack to the north, then you also perform a melee attack to your north. If your previous ally in the turn order casts a spell three squares to the east, then you also cast that same spell three squares to your own east.
