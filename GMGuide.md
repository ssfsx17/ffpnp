## Final Fantasy Plot Structure

It is possible to make other types of stories, but they would not be "Final Fantasy" stories. There is nothing wrong with other types of stories, but they tend not to fit the over-the-top power progression that is core to the series.

1. Get thrown into a conflict immediately.
2. The heroes earn a small success within the conflict.
3. The evil empire makes a big move.
4. Chase the villain around, encounter plot twists, possibly reveal more and more villains who are higher up in the food chain.
5. The villain makes an even bigger move.
6. Shocking twists that show deep connections between the heroes and villains.
7. Celestial space monster out of nowhere. It threatens to blow up the whole planet, or possibly even the whole universe. The heroes beat it. The end.

Key Points:

- The stakes are both personal and global. The heroes want to rescue and protect their most beloved ones. The evil empire can crack the planet in half. Even if the heroes start out as mercenaries with no higher motivation, they must inevitably be embroiled in grandiose schemes that threaten their existence.
- There's a bloody-obvious evil to fight against. Generally, it has plenty of minions in the form of an evil empire. If there seem to be two opposing factions of equal morality, then they're both being manipulated by the true evil.
- Celestial space monster out of nowhere. It probably spouts off a bunch of nihilism and solipsism. It also commits all sorts of logical fallacies when explaining why it has any kind of legal or moral authority.
- The newer Final Fantasy games give hints about the celestial space monster in the earlier sections of the story. But, its true nature is still generally not revealed until near the end.

How other types of stories might be Final Fantasized:

- **Cthulhu** - Its name is not mentioned for at least 4/5ths of the story. The entire city of Boston has to be evacuated in the introduction, before characters have even been created. Deep Ones overrun the entire North American continent in the first half of the story. A humongous crater is blown through Mount Everest at some point in the second half of the story. It ends with the heroes going to Cthulhu's lair underneath the ocean, waking it up, and killing it. Yeah, that's right, killing it.

## Monsters

In video games, you can grind mobs for a few hours and put the story on hold. In pen & paper role-playing games, that is possible, but it would not be bringing out the strengths of this beautiful medium.

In the core FF P&P rules, monsters exist primarily for flavor. They provide no inherent rewards, although there may be longer-term benefits to gathering their body parts.

The average monster has the following statistics:

- Monster Level = the party's average Experience Level
- Maximum HP = M-Level * M-Level * 2
- Maximum MP = M-Level * 10
- Physical Damage = M-Level * M-Level
- Accuracy & Magic Accuracy = M-Level * 2
- Evasion & Magic Evasion = M-Level * 1.5
- Defense & Magic Defense = M-Level * M-Level * 0.5
- Monster HP is not subject to the HP Limit

Since monsters have no inherent rewards, the GM is free to give XP and JP incentives if the party seeks out tougher-than-average monsters, or to reduce XP and JP awards if the party seeks out weaker-than-average monsters.

Suggested traits for boss monsters:

- HP is multiplied by 20 or more.
- MP is multiplied by 5 or more
- +50 Evasion and Magic Evasion against status effects and HP-reducing effects, or halved effectiveness of these.
- Successful instant-death are converted to 9999 damage.
- Successful HP-reducing effects are capped at 9999 damage.

## Rewards

XP: Experience Level * Experience Level * 1,000
- A table is provided for easier referencing.
- This means that, assuming a pace of 1 session per week, level 99 can be reached in roughly one year.

JP: Experience Level * 10

Gil: Experience Level * 2,000

Additional XP and JP can be incentivized through a variety of options:

- The players perform good roleplaying, play their characters to the hilt, entertain each other, and make for a good time overall.
- The players write character journals.
- The players actively participate in the Story Point system.
- The party seeks out sidequests.
- The party seeks to train, grind mobs, and challenge themselves. The GM should make the combats much harder for such a session, or impose conditions such as "get a monster to 10% HP but don't kill it".
