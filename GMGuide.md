## Final Fantasy Plot Structure

It is possible to make other types of stories, but they would not be "Final Fantasy" stories. There is nothing wrong with other types of stories, but they tend not to fit the over-the-top power progression that is core to the series.

1. Get thrown into a conflict immediately.
2. The heroes earn a small success within the conflict.
3. The evil empire makes a big move.
4. Chase the villain around, encounter plot twists, possibly reveal more and more villains who are higher up in the food chain.
5. The villain makes an even bigger move.
6. Shocking twists that show deep connections between the heroes and villains.
7. Celestial space monster out of nowhere. It threatens to blow up the whole planet, or possibly even the whole universe. The heroes beat it. The end.

Key Points:

- The stakes are both personal and global. The heroes want to rescue and protect their most beloved ones. The evil empire can crack the planet in half. Even if the heroes start out as mercenaries with no higher motivation, they must inevitably be embroiled in grandiose schemes that threaten their existence.
- There's a bloody-obvious evil to fight against. Generally, it has plenty of minions in the form of an evil empire. If there seem to be two opposing factions of equal morality, then they're both being manipulated by the true evil.
- Celestial space monster out of nowhere. It probably spouts off a bunch of nihilism and solipsism. It also commits all sorts of logical fallacies when explaining why it has any kind of legal or moral authority.
- The newer Final Fantasy games give hints about the celestial space monster in the earlier sections of the story. But, its true nature is still generally not revealed until near the end.

How other types of stories might be Final Fantasized:

- **Cthulhu** - Its name is not mentioned for at least 4/5ths of the story. The entire city of Boston has to be evacuated in the introduction, before characters have even been created. Deep Ones overrun the entire North American continent in the first half of the story. A humongous crater is blown through Mount Everest at some point in the second half of the story. It ends with the heroes going to Cthulhu's lair underneath the ocean, waking it up, and killing it. Yeah, that's right, killing it.

## Higher Starting Levels

Character levels 1 through 20 are meant to help both the players and the GM get used to the rules. If the players make use of every possible rule that could help them, then the suggested numbers for monsters could be excessively easy at these levels. Character "builds" do not become especially unique until experience level 20, either.

If both the GM and the players are already comfortable with the rules, then the GM can simply start on a higher session number, according to the suggested rewards table. To start on experience level 10, use the accumulated rewards of session 6. To start on experience level 20, use the accumulated rewards of session 10.

## The Day to Day Stuff

### Long Rests

How long is a long rest? Long enough for a potential consequence. Usually, a long rest is roughly eight hours, but it could be longer or shorter depending on the dramatic situation. The Player-Characters should be careful of doing too many long rests, or trying to use multiple cheaper resting items rather than the latest ones.

Examples of what can happen during a long rest:

- Predatory monsters come to attack the party.
- A distant town loses an important battle.
- The Evil Empire's scouts discover where the party is resting, and plan a rapid response that arrives in the middle or end of the long rest.
- The Ultimate Evil is able to do one plot-critical action.

## Monsters

In video games, you can grind mobs for a few hours and put the story on hold. In pen & paper role-playing games, that is possible, but it would not be bringing out the strengths of this beautiful medium.

In the core FF P&P rules, monsters exist primarily for flavor. They provide no inherent rewards, although there may be longer-term benefits to gathering their body parts. Monsters should exist primarily for some dramatic purpose, or because the players actively seek them out. If monsters exist solely as filler between Point-A and Point-B, with no consequences for running away or taking too long to fight them, or nothing dramatic to be gained from seeking out some specific variety of monster, then the FF P&P game comes dangerously close to just being a simplified MMORPG.

On the other hand, the Ultimate Evil of the game is highly likely to use brute force as one of its many tools for turning the world towards evil. Brute force tends to take the form of random monsters. It would be strange if the Ultimate Evil did not send its minions to try to kill or slow down the heroes at least once in a while. Therefore, some examples are given for how to make monsters have dramatic purpose:

- The monsters are guarding a story item.
- The monsters are actually controlled by good people, who want to test the player-characters' mettle before agreeing to help.
- If the player-characters take too long to kill a group of monsters, then some innocent people will die.
- The player-characters are all that stand between the monsters and a critical story item.
- The Ultimate Evil is using logical military strategies and tactics against the player-characters, and monsters are a cheap and plentiful resource for the Ultimate Evil.
- Some innocent person wandered off and got ambushed by wild monsters, necessitating rescue.
- The player-characters intentionally seek out monsters to push themselves to the limit, hone their skills, and gain useful things from the monsters' corpses or whatever the monsters were guarding.

The suggested average monster has the following statistics:

- Monster Level = the party's average Experience Level
- Average Attributes = M-Level + 10
- Maximum HP = (M-Level + 10) * M-Level * 2
- Maximum MP = M-Level * 10
- Damage Output = (M-Level + 20) * M-Level
- Accuracy & Magic Accuracy = (M-Level * 2) + 10
- Evasion & Magic Evasion = (M-Level * 1.5) + 20
- Defense & Magic Defense = (M-Level + 20) * M-Level * 0.5, or half of damage output
- Monster HP is not subject to the HP Limit

Since monsters have no inherent rewards, the GM is free to give incentives if the party seeks out tougher-than-average monsters, or to reduce rewards if the party seeks out weaker-than-average monsters.

Suggested traits for boss monsters:

- HP is multiplied by 10, 20, 50, or more.
- MP is multiplied by 5 or more.
- +50 Evasion and Magic Evasion against status effects and HP-reducing effects, or halved effectiveness of these.
- Successful instant-death effects are converted to 9999 damage.
- Successful HP-reducing effects, or other damages based on maximum HP, are capped at 9999 damage.
- Attacks twice per action.

Precalculated average monsters and bosses are provided in the following formats:

- [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jI1CjCPBuhVCI4bKV9r5uEl5KE1PVM5n6Z-foHFVYt0/edit?usp=sharing)

Ultimately, the given numbers are **suggestions** assuming average comfort with rules and numbers. The GM can write whatever they want. The GM can choose to round off the ones places, tens places, or even hundreds places of numbers. If all of the players must be reminded to buy new gear, and they dare not perform actions other than "attack," then the GM can just halve some numbers. If all of the players spend their entire free time between sessions on planning their characters, then the GM can just increase some numbers by 50% or 100%, or whatever other fudging. The end goal is to make the players feel good that they expanded their minds and used mental effort in order to overcome challenges.

### Examples of Non-Average Templates

Non-Average monsters should be mixed in with average ones, to keep the players challenged. Every GM should get an idea of what types of challenges their players do and do not enjoy. Some example templates are provided to inspire GMs to think of even crazier templates and monster mechanics that are more specific to their campaigns.

It is recommended that the only way player-characters can possess certain information about a monster's templates and special mechanics is through the Libra spell, or equivalent effect.

**Countering:**

- The monster counterattacks against any physical damage.

**Dragon:**

- The monster has a breath ability that does M-Level * M-Level * 0.5 magical elemental damage, to all player-characters. The element depends on the dragon type. It uses the breath ability once every 2 or 3 rounds.

**Elemental:**

- The monster is healed by one element, but takes double damage from another.
- The monster's attack damage is changed to be of the element.

**Elusive:**

- The monster runs away in the 2nd combat round.
- Upon death, the monster drops something that is 5 item levels higher.

**Flying:**

- The monster is always under the effect of Float status.
- The monster's Evasion is increased by 50.
- The monster takes double-damage from Dragoon abilities that are based on weapon attacks.

**Grappling:**

- The monster's attacks always attempt to cause Disable and Immobilize status on hit (2).

**Humanoid:**

- The monster starts with at least 1 AP.
- The monster has job abilities, with a maximum job level equal to the player-characters' highest job level.
- The monster drops a piece of equipment upon death, appropriate for its job.

**Incorporeal:**

- Maximum HP is halved.
- Maximum MP is doubled.
- The monster is always under the effect of Vanish status.

- Magic Defense is halved.

**Multiattacking:**

- Attacks twice per action.

**Poisonous:**

- The monster's attacks always attempt to cause Poison status on hit.

**Power-Attacking:**

- On the first round of combat, flip a coin. On a heads, the monster attacks during the first round.
- The monster skips its action every 2nd round.
- Attack Damage is increased by 50%.
- Accuracy is increased by 50.

**Raging:**

- The monster enters Berserk status upon taking physical damage.

**Rare:**

- Maximum HP is doubled.
- Attack Damage is increased by 50%.
- Upon death, the monster drops something that is 10 item levels higher.

**Reinforcing:**

- On the monster's action, flip a coin. On a heads, the monster brings an additional monster into the combat.

**Small:**

- Maximum HP is halved.
- Evasion and Magic Evasion are increased by 100.
- Defense is halved.

**Thorny:**

- 10% of all damage done to the monster is also done to the one who caused that damage. No Evasion or Defense is applied.

**Undead:**

- The monster is always under the effect of Zombie status.

## Suggested Rewards per Session

The suggested rewards are based on the estimate that groups who play indie and hobbyist games will want to try a new one every half year, as such groups are likely to have a ratio of 10 RPG books owned per 1 book actually used. If the group cycles through games every six to eight weeks, then the suggested rewards should also be sufficient to give a taste of nearly every single aspect of the game's rules.

XP: Session Number * Session Number * 500

- This means that level 99 will be reached in roughly 31 sessions using the suggested XP rewards.

JP: Session Number * 10

Gil: Session Number * 1,000

Donations from NPCs: Half of Gil reward in value

Additional rewards can be incentivized through a variety of options:

- The players perform good roleplaying, play their characters to the hilt, entertain each other, and make for a good time overall.
- The players write character journals.
- The players actively participate in the Story Point system.
- The party seeks out sidequests.
- The party seeks to train and challenge themselves. The GM should make the combats much harder for such a session, or impose conditions such as "get a monster to 10% HP but don't kill it".

### Epic-Length Campaigns

Cutting the XP reward to 20% (i.e. Session Number * Session Number * 100) will result in reaching level 99 in 53 sessions.

The GM can also choose to not hand out XP at all. Instead, the GM would declare that characters improve 1 experience level per 1 to 3 sessions, and cut JP and Gil rewards in half.
