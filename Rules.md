# Rules

## Story Points

Each player starts each game session with five Story Points. The GM has infinite Story Points. Story Points are held by players, rather than their characters, just in case there is more than one character per player.

If one of the characters' Three Things is purely negative or disadvantageous, then the GM may give that character's player an additional Story Point per session.

Story Points can be offered to a player in order to cause certain kinds of events. If that player accepts, then the event happens. Examples include:

- Story setback or disadvantage
- That player's character has a personal crisis
- Nullifying the results of one of their character's actions

Story Points can be spent to:

- Double the results of an action.
- Nullify the results of an action.
- Guarantee success for an Accuracy or Skill roll.

When the session ends, all unused Story Points are wasted. Use them or lose them.

## Skill Checks

Roll 1d100 + any relevant job levels. If the job you are currently wearing is relevant, then you get an additional bonus of 50. The GM may additionally give bonuses if you have a relevant attribute at a high number.

Example: Identifying a suit of armor. The roll could be defined by the GM as 1d100 + Squire + Fighter + Knight.

Suggested difficulties for skill checks:

- Very Easy - Everyone who does this as a hobby can do it: 25
- Easy - Everyone who does this for their job can do it all the time. Hobbyists can do it with enough practice: 50
- Normal - Only some hobbyists can do it: 100
- Hard - People who do this for their job generally try not to do it: 150
- Very Hard - Only experts in their jobs can do it: 200

## The Meaning of Statistics

Health Points (HP) - Reaching 0 HP results in unconsciousness. Unconscious characters cannot be healed until they are revived by other means. Unconsciousness cancels all other status conditions.

Mana Points (MP) - Used for a large variety of abilities.

Action Points (AP) - Start at 0 for every combat, then slowly fills in over time. This stands in for "Charge Time" and other such mechanics.

## Elements

There are two dimensions to elements. The first dimension is binary: physical or magical. The second dimension is as follows:

- Air
- Dark
- Earth
- Fire
- Holy
- Ice
- Lightning
- Non-Elemental
- Poison
- Water
