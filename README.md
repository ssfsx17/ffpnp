# 1. Introduction

## Not All About Combat

The term "role-playing game" is often interpreted to mean a game of combat. Some time must be spent managing numbers in order to fare better at combat, as opposed to being purely about skill within the combat situations. Many of them happen to be about knights and soldiers, who then proceed to engage in a lot of combat as befits their jobs.

But in reality, role-playing games are about playing any kind of role. Imagine a game where one person pretends to be an average person on the street, and the other person pretends to be a salesman giving a pitch - that is just as much of a role-playing game.

## Improvised Acting

Role-playing games are more fun when you are able to get into your role and explore what it is like to be someone else. Although there can be a considerable number of rules, they do not determine what situations you will actually face. You must endure all sorts of things never seen before, things conjured by the imagination of others, and react just as your role would.

## True Choices & Consequences

Video games must have all their choices & consequences pre-written. Even when attempting procedural generation, the possibile traits must still be pre-written.

With role-playing games, however, anything can happen. True consequences and reactivity are possible, since you are dealing with other people playing their roles, rather than with some pre-built system. If you have played your role as a pure paragon, then you can ensure that the ending of the game reflects this, and possibly even convince your enemies that they are wrong and ought to cease their harmful actions. Likewise, if you have played your role as a pure renegade, then perhaps there is a way to destroy your bitter enemy through your own ingenuity, rather than resorting to contrived plot devices. You do not have to accept that the game simply ends with one of three choices, each of which causes different-colored explosions.

## All Rules are Optional

Each group of people finds that different rules suit their needs and personalities the best. It is natural, and even encouraged, that each gaming group would therefore add, remove, and change rules.

Any changes that are considered to be just plain better, rather than a matter of taste, should be discussed on the official Discord. If there is great favor towards the changes, then they will be adopted as official.

## Differences to other Final Fantasy-inspired RPGs:

This is not the first attempt to write a role-playing game based on the Final Fantasy franchise, nor will it be the last. The key points of difference are listed below:

- Tries to emulate the number scale of the Final Fantasy video games, rather than the Seiken Densetsu or Chrono Trigger games. Why settle for 999 HP when you can have 9999 HP! This does, however, cause removal of dice rolling in other aspects of the game.
  - No dice are rolled for damage outputs, except for special cases.
  - No dice are rolled for HP or MP gain at levelup.
- The Job system is taken primarily from the games that have changeable jobs.
  - Jobs don't have to have the same number of abilities, or even be remotely equal in power. Jobs are instead "balanced" by being more rear-loaded or requiring a lot of other Job levels. The video games were, after all, based heavily on letting you feel extremely overpowered if you did enough grinding. Can't beat a boss? Just grind some more.
  - No need for certain jobs to be different from each other just for the sake of it. It's okay for some jobs to just be other jobs stuck together, or to be other jobs with better bonuses.
  - Intentionally allowing overpowered combinations at high levels, especially through the Ultima Freelancer job. Figuring out the overpowered strategies is a key component of the Final Fantasy combat experience.
- No skill system. Instead, relevant Job levels are added together for skill checks.
- Avoids percentages as much as possible, except for 5%, 10%, 50%, and whole-number multiples. Weapons do use other numbers, but since no dice are rolled for weapon damage, the complexity impact is mitigated.
- Maximalist approach. Inclusion of jobs and abilities is preferred compared to exclusion, except where it could make the math too complex.

History with the Returners FFRPG: I was there for a tiny bit of the 3rd edition development. My name is there somewhere. It was a learning experience.
