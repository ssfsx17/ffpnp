[Official Discord for FF FPNP](https://discord.gg/vESjVeSTsw)

Current Status: rebooted, needs a lot of testing, but theoretically playable for all jobs that were in FFT, also has some other fan-favorite jobs

## I just want to GM or play

Three readable formats are provided:

- `index.html` - Single big web page
- `Final Fantasy Fan Pen & Paper.pdf` - Printable format
- `readable.md` - Read the game rules from your web browser at GitHub

## How to Build

1. Install pandoc
2. Install miktex
3. Run `./build.sh`
4. You will get the following outputs:
  - `readable.md` - markdown designed for GitHub's viewer
  - `index.html` - single webpage
  - `Final Fantasy Fan Pen & Paper.pdf` - single document for PDF readers & printers

## What's left to be done?

Playtest the game a lot.

Finish Espers.

Finish jobs from Final Fantasy XIV which I have not played yet (e.g. Thaumaturgist and Reaper).

Port some abilities from Final Fantasy XI and XIV, for those jobs which do not have enough abilities right now.
