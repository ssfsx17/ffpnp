# Devout

Requires: [White Mage](/Jobs/JobDetails/WhiteMage.md) 10

Actions:
- Attack
- Defend
- Charge
- White Magic
- Pray (10 AP) - Roll 1d100 + Spirit against a target number of 150. On a success, the second-best available White Magic healing spell is cast on the party, as if it were multi-targeted, with no MP cost. If the dice show 90-100, it casts Raise on all unconscious party members first, then does the Pray effect on the party. You must have access to the White or Red Magic action - either as a Job Action or as a Choice Action - in order to use the Pray ability. Out-of-combat, you can pray to restore half of the party's HP during a long rest.
