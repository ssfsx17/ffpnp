# Jobs

Jobs can be freely changed during a full rest, as long as characters meet the requirements.

The price of a job level in JP is equal to the level multiplied by 10. The following table is provided for convenience:

| JL | Cost to Buy | Cumulative Cost | Other Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 10 JP | 10 JP
| 2 | 20 JP | 30 JP
| 3 | 30 JP | 60 JP
| 4 | 40 JP | 100 JP
| 5 | 50 JP | 150 JP
| 6 | 60 JP | 210 JP
| 7 | 70 JP | 280 JP
| 8 | 80 JP | 360 JP
| 9 | 90 JP | 450 JP
| 10 | 100 JP | 550 JP | Prestige Job Title
| 11 | 110 JP | 660 JP
| 12 | 120 JP | 780 JP
| 13 | 130 JP | 910 JP
| 14 | 140 JP | 1050 JP
| 15 | 150 JP | 1200 JP
| 16 | 160 JP | 1360 JP
| 17 | 170 JP | 1530 JP
| 18 | 180 JP | 1710 JP
| 19 | 190 JP | 1900 JP
| 20 | 200 JP | 2100 JP | Mastered

Improving a Job to Job Level 10 will gain a Prestige Job Title, indicating great expertise compared to any mortal. Improving a Job to Job level 20 makes it Mastered.

All Jobs are inherently magical. Their abilities might express this magic in different ways. There is no such thing as a person who can slice all enemies in a single stroke without the aid of magic. If someone can slice all enemies in a single stroke, they are getting some sort of constant magical power from their Job. Furthermore, it is possible that Jobs can change clothing style, equipment detailing, hairstyle, makeup, and other such visible features. For example, if someone is currently a Knight and they change jobs to Dark Knight, then their armor could suddenly turn black and grow a bunch of sharp edges and spikes.

If a job has an action from another job, then that action is usable according to what has been unlocked for choice, as opposed to what has been unlocked for job use. For example, you must have White Mage 20 (mastered) in order to use White Magic T10 with any other job that has the White Magic action, such as Devout or Paladin.

## Optional: Plotline Job Requirements

The GM may choose to impose plot requirements to buy the first Job Level of any Job. These requirements can be in addition to, or a replacement of, their existing requirements. For example, the GM may rule that no jobs other than the base jobs are available. The Player Characters may later encounter a Crystal of Wind that gives them access to Fighter, Thief, White Mage, and Black Mage.

The GM could also require the Player Characters to seek out hidden masters, ancient artifacts, unique opponents, personal quests, and other such things to gain access to the first Job Level of specific Jobs. For example, the only way to learn the Holy Knight job may be to undertake an ordeal on a sacred mountain.

## Optional: Job Usage Requirements

The GM may choose to require that Player Characters spend an entire game session without changing jobs. Furthermore, all JP earned for that session are allocated only to the jobs they were playing. Jobs can still be changed outside of game sessions.

## Optional: Job Level Capped by Experience Level

The GM may choose to impose a cap of Job Level being no higher than Experience Level * 0.2. In that case, the maximum job level would be according to the following table:

| Experience Level | Maximum Job Level | Other Notes |
| ---              | ---               | ---         |
| 1                | 1                 |
| 10 | 2 |
| 15 | 3 |
| 20 | 4 |
| 25 | 5 |
| 30 | 6 |
| 35 | 7 |
| 40 | 8 |
| 45 | 9 |
| 50 | 10 |
| 55 | 11 |
| 60 | 12 |
| 65 | 13 |
| 70 | 14 |
| 75 | 15 |
| 80 | 16 |
| 85 | 17 |
| 90 | 18 |
| 95 | 19 |
| - | 20 | Most likely requires a sidequest to unlock |

## Job Description Format

Requires: Which other job levels must be purchased, before the first job level in this job can be.

Actions: In most cases, this is Attack, Defend, Charge, Item, and something unique to the job or a prerequisite job. If the action comes from a different job, then it is only usable according to what has been unlocked for general choices. For example, the Magus job has the Black Magic action. In order for a Magus to cast a spell from Black Magic T10, you would need Black Mage Job Level 20.

Supports: Passive abilities that are always on.

Reactions: Tend to require AP to trigger. The descriptions of various reactions will also imply specific conditions under which they can be triggered.

Proficiencies: What can be equipped.

Job Levels: A table of various things that occur at each job level.

- Job Action/Support/Reaction/Proficiency: Becomes inherent to the job.
- Action/Support/Reaction/Proficiency Unlock: Made available as a choice option. In many cases, Action unlocks will also expand the abilities and spells that are available to certain other jobs.
- Prestige Job Title: New job title. Purely cosmetic, although the GM may create situations in which the job title is important.

## Job Index

Jobs in a higher PR are not necessarily better than ones in a lower PR. PRs are only a descriptor of the length of the requirements chain. In many cases, a job in a lower PR could require more JP to unlock than a job in a higher PR.
