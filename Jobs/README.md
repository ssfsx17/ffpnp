Jobs can be freely changed during sleep, as long as characters meet the requirements.

The price of a job level in JP is equal to the level multiplied by 10. Job level 10 is Mastered, and changes it into its Prestige Job. Job level 20 is Prestige Mastered. The following table is provided for convenience:

| JL | Cost to Buy | Cumulative Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 10 JP | 10 JP
| 2 | 20 JP | 30 JP
| 3 | 30 JP | 60 JP
| 4 | 40 JP | 100 JP
| 5 | 50 JP | 150 JP
| 6 | 60 JP | 210 JP

All Jobs are inherently magical. Their abilities might express this magic in different ways. There is no such thing as a person who can slice all enemies in a single stroke without the aid of magic. If someone can slice all enemies in a single stroke, they are getting some sort of constant magical power from their Job.

If a job has an action from another job, then that action is usable according to what has been unlocked for choice, as opposed to what has been unlocked for job use. For example, you must have White Mage 20 in order to use White Magic T10 with any other job that has the White Magic action.

## Job Description Format

Requires: Which other job levels must be purchased, before the first job level in this job can be.

Actions: In most cases, this is Attack, Defend, Charge, Item, and something unique to the job or a prerequisite job. If the action comes from a different job, then it is only usable according to what has been unlocked for general choices. For example, the Magus job has the Black Magic action. In order to cast a spell from Black Magic T10, you would need Black Mage Job Level 20.

Supports: Passive abilities.

Reactions: Tend to require AP to trigger. The descriptions of various reactions will also imply specific conditions under which they can be triggered.

Proficiencies: What can be equipped.

Job Levels: A table of various things that occur at each job level.

- Job Action/Support/Reaction/Proficiency: Becomes inherent to the job.
- Action/Support/Reaction/Proficiency Unlock: Made available as a choice option. In many cases, Action unlocks will also expand the abilities and spells that are available to certain other jobs.
- Prestige Job: New job title. Purely cosmetic, although the GM may create situations in which the job title is important.

## Job Index

Jobs in a higher PR are not necessarily better than ones in a lower PR. PRs are only a descriptor of the length of the requirements chain. In many cases, a job in a lower PR could require more JP to unlock than a job in a higher PR.
