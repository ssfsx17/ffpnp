# Special Traits

All characters start with three Special Traits, and may potentially gain more, or change existing ones, according to the story.

## Background Traits

**Awakening** - You have a number of rounds of Awakening energy equal to 1/10th of your Experience Level, rounded down, to a minimum of 1 round. You can spend an action to enter or cease Awakening. While in Awakening, your Strength, Vitality, and Agility are doubled. You refresh your Awakening energy after a long rest.

**Civilian Experience** - For your starting civilian job, you start at Job Level 20 instead of 1.

**Job Training** - You start at Job Level 1 in one job of choice. You must meet its requirements to gain additional Job Levels in it.

**Morph** - You have a number of rounds of Morph energy equal to 1/10th of your Experience Level, rounded down, to a minimum of 1 round. You can spend an action to enter or cease Morph. While Morphed, your Strength, Intellect, and Spirit are doubled. You refresh your Morph energy after a long rest.

## Unique Abilities

**Role Skill: Damage** - Every time you do an action that causes HP loss to an enemy, you gain 1 stack of Attack Sequence. You can hold a maximum of 4 stacks of Attack Sequence. You can do an action to expend the 4 stacks of Attack Sequence in order to perform two single-target damaging actions to the same target. You must pay the costs of these damaging actions normally.

**Role Skill: Healer** - You can double the cost of an action (MP, AP, Gil, Items, etc.) in order to activate it at the beginning of the initiative order. This does cause you to lose your action for the rest of the round, however. This can be applied to actions that restore HP or revive downed party members.

**Role Skill: Tank** - You can spend an action to transfer all party members' Enmity, Enmity-Major, and Enmity-Plus statuses to yourself. This additionally has the effect of a Defend action.

**Two-Hour Ability** - Once per two hours, you can spend an action to activate your Two-Hour Ability. This cuts the MP and AP costs of actions for *one* job of choice in half, for a duration of 4 status phases. This affects yourself only.
