# Introduction

## What is Final Fantasy?

Final Fantasy is a massive franchise owned by Square-Enix Ltd. It started out as
a video game derivative of Dungeons & Dragons, with four Warriors of Light
fighting against Chaos in order to save the world. It has since developed and
encompassed just about every possible hero-saves-the-world plot possible. Each
full Final Fantasy game is its own universe, such that there is no plotline
continuity between games, although there are numerous common trappings and other
elements. Some games have become franchises in themselves with their own
sequels, with the biggest sub-franchise being Final Fantasy VII, and the
highest-budget sub-franchise being Final Fantasy XV.

If FF P&P is your first encounter with this grand multiverse, worry not. Start
with what you have in front of you. Get adjusted to your gaming group, and adapt
to the setting that is put forth by your Game Master.

## Not All About Combat

The term “role-playing game” is often interpreted to mean a game of combat. Some
time must be spent managing numbers in order to fare better at combat, as
opposed to being purely about skill within the combat situations. Many of them
happen to be about knights and soldiers, who then proceed to engage in a lot of
combat as befits their jobs.

But in reality, role-playing games are about playing any kind of role. Imagine a
game where one person pretends to be an average person on the street, and the
other person pretends to be a salesman giving a pitch - that is just as much of
a role-playing game.

## Improvised Acting

Role-playing games are more fun when you are able to get into your role and
explore what it is like to be someone else. Although there can be a considerable
number of rules, they do not determine what situations you will actually face.
You must endure all sorts of things never seen before, things conjured by the
imagination of others, and react just as your role would.

## True Choices & Consequences

Video games must have all their choices & consequences pre-written. Even when
attempting procedural generation, the possibile traits must still be
pre-written.

With role-playing games, however, anything can happen. True consequences and
reactivity are possible, since you are dealing with other people playing their
roles, rather than with some pre-built system. If you have played your role as a
pure paragon, then you can ensure that the ending of the game reflects this, and
possibly even convince your enemies that they are wrong and ought to cease their
harmful actions. Likewise, if you have played your role as a pure renegade, then
perhaps there is a way to destroy your bitter enemy through your own ingenuity,
rather than resorting to contrived plot devices. You do not have to accept that
the game simply ends with one of three choices, each of which causes
different-colored explosions.

## All Rules are Optional

Each group of people finds that different rules suit their needs and
personalities the best. It is natural, and even encouraged, that each gaming
group would therefore add, remove, and change rules.

Any changes that are considered to be just plain better, rather than a matter of
taste, should be discussed on the official Discord. If there is great favor
towards the changes, then they will be adopted as official.

## Differences to other Final Fantasy-inspired Pen & Paper Games:

This is not the first attempt to write a role-playing game based on the Final
Fantasy franchise, nor will it be the last. In fact it is quite good for
hobbyist scenes when more people get into them and make their own take, so that
everyone in the scene can learn from each other and change their own ideas of
perfection. Considering how large the franchise is, it would be more worrying if
people somehow did *not* have varying opinions.

The key points of difference are listed below:

-   The number scale of the Final Fantasy video games, rather than the Seiken
    Densetsu or Chrono Trigger games. Why settle for 999 HP when you can have
    9999 HP! This does, however, cause removal of dice rolling in most other
    aspects of the game.
-   The Job system is taken primarily from games that have changeable jobs and
    dresspheres. This means there will be weaker starting jobs and stronger
    unlockable jobs. The late game purposely involves powerful combinations of
    abilities.
-   No skill system. Instead, relevant Job levels are added together for skill
    checks.
-   Maximalist approach. Inclusion of jobs and abilities is preferred compared
    to exclusion.

# Player Characters

## Character Creation Process

1.  Write the Three Things about your character.
2.  Experience Level = 1
3.  Battle Atttributes, starting with 100 Battle Attribute Points
4.  Civil Stats & Combat Stats
5.  Initiative Roll
6.  Special Traits
7.  Starting Civilian Jobs - Choose two different Civilian Jobs to start at Job
    Level 10.
8.  Starting Combat Jobs - [Chemist](#chemist), [Freelancer](#freelancer) and
    [Squire](#squire) start at Job Level 1. Then, choose either Chemist or
    Squire to start at 10 instead.
9.  Starting Items and Equipment
10. Starting flexible JP - 10 JP, to be spent between [Chemist](#chemist),
    [Freelancer](#freelancer) and [Squire](#squire).

## Three Things

Write three things that make your character unique. They can encompass personal
history, relation to the world, physical appearance, or anything else that sets
your character apart.

## Experience Level

Experience Level (LVL) is a significant factor in many calculations. As a
general rule, Player Characters gain one, two or three Experience Levels (LVL)
per game session, depending on the pace desired by the group.

## Battle Attributes

| Battle Attribute  | Explanation                                                  |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Strength**      | damage for most melee weapons, helps reduce equipment weight |
| **Dexterity**     | damage for some weapons, physical accuracy                   |
| **Agility**       | physical evasion                                             |
| **Speed**         | initiative                                                   |
| **Vitality**      | maximum HP                                                   |
| **Stamina**       | HP regen from Charge Up actions, inherent physical armor     |
| **Intellect**     | magical damage, magical accuracy                             |
| **Wisdom**        | healing power                                                |
| **Mind**          | maximum MP, magical evasion                                  |
| **Spirit**        | MP regen from Charge Up actions, inherent magical armor      |
| **Tenacity**      | maximum TP                                                   |
| **Determination** | TP charge from Charge Up actions, as well as passive TP gain |

You start with 100 Battle Attribute Points, and gain 100 more with each
Experience Level. Thus, your total number of Battle Attribute Points will be
equal to Experience Level \* 100.

No one battle attribute can have more than triple the number of points as
another battle attribute. For example, if you have allocated 900 points to
Strength, then all your other battle attributes must have at least 300 points
allocated to them.

|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Health Points (HP)**        | 100 + (LVL \* Vitality)       | How much punishment you can take before dying. When your current HP reaches 0 or less, you are dead.                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Magic Points (MP)**         | 100 + (LVL \* Mind)           | How much magical energy you have for performing various magical techniques. If you die, your current MP are also sent to zero.                                                                                                                           |
| **Technique Points (TP)**     | 100 + (LVL \* Tenacity)       | How much battle technique energy you can hold during combat. After any amount of rest, your current TP are sent to zero. If you die, your current TP are also sent to zero.                                                                              |
| **Physical Accuracy (P-Acc)** | LVL + Dexterity               | Your skill at performing physical attacks. If your P-Acc is high enough then you will have a chance of performing Critical Hits. If your P-Acc is too low then you will perform Glancing Hits, or even start missing.                                    |
| **Physical Evasion (P-Eva)**  | LVL + Agility                 | Your skill at avoiding physical attacks. If your P-Eva is high enough then you will receive Glancing Hits instead of Direct Hits, or even avoid attacks entirely. If your P-Eva is too low then you will have a chance of receiving Critical Hits.       |
| **Physical Defense (P-Def)**  | 10 + (LVL \* Vitality \* 0.1) | Resistance to physical damage. If your P-Def is high enough then your HP will go quite far.                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Magical Accuracy (M-Acc)**  | LVL + Intellect               | Your skill at aiming magical attacks. If your P-Acc is high enough then you will have a chance of performing Critical Hits.

| **Magical Evasion (M-Eva)**   | LVL + Mind                    | Your skill at disappearing from magic attacks.

| **Magical Defense (M-Def)**   | 10 + (LVL \* Spirit \* 0.1)   | Resistance to magical damage. If your M-Def is high enough then your HP will go quite far.                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Weight Capacity**           | LVL + Strength                | In general, the more Weight you have above your capacity, the slower you act, and consequently the more susceptible to interruption.                                                                                                                     |

## Initiative Roll

Initiative Roll = 1d100 + Experience Level + Speed - Excess Weight

## Starting Civilian Jobs

Choose two different Civilian Jobs to start at Job Level 20. All other Civilian
Jobs are initially unlearned.

## Starting Combat Jobs

[Chemist](#chemist), [Freelancer](#freelancer) and [Squire](#squire) start at
Job Level 1. Then, choose either [Chemist](#chemist) or [Squire](#squire) to
start at Job Level 10 instead.

## Starting Items and Equipment

1 full set of gathering gear of Item Level 1

1 full set of crafting gear of Item Level 1

Your choice of combat job to start at Job Level 10 determines which of the
following sets you get:

1.  [Chemist](#chemist) set = 1H Dagger and full set of Magic armor, all at Item
    Level 1
2.  [Squire](#squire) set = 1H Sword and full set of War armor, all at Item
    Level 1

You do not need to maintain your starting items and equipment, but it is always
at Item Level 1. Therefore you must start gathering and crafting, as well as
cooperate with others, in order to have better stuff.

## Special Traits

All characters start with three Special Traits, and may potentially gain more,
or change existing ones, according to the story.

**Awakening** - You have a number of rounds of Awakening energy equal to 1/10th
of your Experience Level, rounded down, to a minimum of 1 round. You can spend
an action to enter or cease Awakening. While in Awakening, your Strength,
Vitality, and Agility are doubled. You refresh your Awakening energy after a
Long Rest.

**Civilian Experience** - You start with ten different Civilian Jobs at Job
Level 20, rather than two.

**Desperation Attack** - While your Current HP is less than one-fourth of your
Maximum HP, your normal Attacks have a 10% chance to be a Desperation Attack
instead. Desperation Attacks target all enemies, and are Direct Critical Hits.

**Job Training: Specific Job** - You start at Job Level 1 in one job of choice.
You must meet its requirements to gain additional Job Levels in it.

**Morph** - You have a number of rounds of Morph energy equal to 1/10th of your
Experience Level, rounded down, to a minimum of 1 round. You can spend an action
to enter or cease Morph. While Morphed, your Strength, Intellect, and Spirit are
doubled. You refresh your Morph energy after a long rest.

**Mystic** - One of your equipment slots is permanently replaced by a Mystic
Body Part. You can bind up to three creatures to your Mystic Body Part, allowing
you to tap into their Job experience or use their unique non-Job abilities. If
binding a creature for its Job experience, then you specifically bind one of its
Jobs, and gain access to the Job Level that the creature had. If binding a
creature for its unique abilities, then you specifically bind one ability which
you can then use at any time. In order to bind a creature, you must defeat it
with a regular Attack action while also declaring that it is a Mystic Binding
attempt.

**Two-Hour Ability** - Once per two hours, you can spend an action to activate
your Two-Hour Ability. This cuts the MP and TP costs of actions from your
current Job in half, for a duration of 4 status phases. This does not affect any
other abilities you are capable of, only those from your current Job.

**Undead** - You permanently have [Zombie status](#status-zombie). In exchange,
whenever you are defeated, you automatically pop up at 1 HP after 4 status
phases.

## What Jobs Should I Aim For?

These paths are merely examples of the order in which to purchase Job Levels,
which fit into typical combat roles. They are not necessarily the best for your
current group, nor the best for your character’s self actualization. Also keep
in mind that, with enough playtime, it is possible to master every single Job in
the game on one character.

Be aware that the party’s need to craft gear and items may require you to spent
JP on Civilian Jobs as well.

## Crafting

In FFP&P, crafting, maintenance, desynthesizing, etc. are all mashed together as
just deciding what crafted items you maintain the existence of. You also do not
have to maintain your starting equipment, although that is always at Item Level
1.

Maximum Item Level for items you craft is equal to whichever is lower from your
Experience Level and relevant Job Level.

**Example:** You have an Experience Level of 20, and an Armorer Job Level of 15.
In this case, the maximum Item Level you can craft for armor is 15.

Item Level reserves from the combined pool of Gathering & Craftsmanship

**High-Quality** items then reserve their Item Level from both Perception &
Control separately. Therefore, on average, only half of your crafted items can
be High-Quality. Such items function as if they were 5 Item Levels higher.

**Example:** You have a crafted item of Item Level 30. You can reserve 30
Gathering, 30 Craftsmanship, 15 Gathering and 15 Craftsmanship, or other
combination. If you want to craft it as High-Quality, then you must additionally
reserve both 30 Perception and 30 Control.

The same item can be crafted multiple times. Each time after the first reserves
half as much of your crafting stats.

**Example:** You have crafted 7 items of the same type, of Item Level 20. This
reserves 80 from your Gathering & Craftsmanship pool. If you want them all to be
crafted at High-Quality then this additionally reserves 80 Perception and 80
Control.

# Rules

## Short Rests and Long Rests

Short rests are any kind of rest that can be had outside of a time-sensitive
situation. As long as you are not being chased, chasing someone else, in the
middle of driving, or any other such scenario, you can probably fit in a short
rest.

Long rests take long enough to potentially result in long-term problems. They
have been classically defined as 8-hour sleeps or breaks, but could be longer or
shorter according to the story’s stakes.

Both types of rest set your current TP to 0.

## Rewards Per Game Session

One, two or three Experience Levels are given for every game session, depending
on the pace of game that is desired.

For each Experience Level gained, characters also receive:

-   100 battle attribute points
-   Flexible Job Points equal to new Experience Level \* 10. For example, a
    Level 1 character advancing to Level 2 will gain 20 JP. A Level 25 character
    advancing to Level 26 will gain 260 JP.

Once the maximum Experience Level is reached, further Game Sessions give a
reward of 1,000 JP each.

An alternate way to view this is to determine your current Battle Attribute
Points and flexible Job Points based solely on your Experience Level:

This view can make it easier for some people to plan their characters over the
long term.

## Levelling Jobs

The cost to learn a new Job is 100 JP. Different game groups may have additional
requirements, such as needing to learn from a specific Job Trainer, or needing
to find Job Crystals.

The cost to improve a Job Level is equal to its current Job Level - for example,
it costs 1 JP to improve from Job Level 1 to 2. It costs 55 JP to improve from
Job Level 55 to 56.

An alternate way to view this is to calculate Job Level in terms of the total
amount of JP spent on the job:

| Job Level | JP Spent | Job Level | JP Spent |
|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **1**     | 100      | **51**    | 1375     |
| **2**     | 101      | **52**    | 1426     |

| **50**    | 1325     |           |          |

Using this view - If you have spent 1,000 JP on a Job, then it is at Job Level
42. If you have spent 2,000 JP on a Job, then it is at Job Level 62. The
[Chemist](#chemist), [Freelancer](#freelancer) and [Squire](#squire) Jobs as
well as chosen Civilian Jobs would implicitly have at least 100 JP spent on each
of them to begin with. Any jobs starting at Job Level 10 would implicitly start
with 145 JP spent on them.

## Learning New Jobs

The first Job Level of any Job can be learned for 100 JP, if you meet the
requirements.

Game groups can add more restrictions on learning new Jobs depending on their
game world:

-   A set of Jobs may be sealed within the Wind Crystal of the world, and cannot
    be learned until the player team journeys to that crystal and defeats its
    guardian.
-   Every single job may be sealed within its own unique Dress Sphere.
    Consequently, each Dress Sphere must be discovered.
-   Jobs may be sealed behind a formal training procedure. Each Job Trainer
    lives in a different major city, and the player team must study under such
    Job Trainers for a period of time before gaining their first Job Levels.

Whichever restrictions are chosen for learning new Jobs, they must be used
consistently for the whole group in perpetuity, as mixing methods will inflict
severe inequality.

## Changing Jobs

You can change your current Job during a Long Rest.

Game groups may choose to add additional methods of changing Jobs which make
sense for their game world:

-   Jobs are socketed into special Job grids. Job grids must be equipped.
    Characters have an additional action in combat to change their Job, but it
    must always be a change from their current one to a linked one on their
    currently-equipped grid.
-   Jobs can be changed at any time, except during dramatic situations and
    combat.
-   Jobs are determined entirely by your current weapon. Therefore, you can
    change jobs simply by changing your weapon, but this could potentially
    result in de-equipping all of your armor instantly, and therefore is
    inadvisable during combat.

Whichever methods of changing Jobs are chosen, they must be used consistently
for the whole game group.

## Skill Chances

Skill Chance = The sum of all relevant Job Levels. If your current Job is
relevant then your Skill is a minimum of 50.

Use two ten-sided dice. Choose one die to be the tens place, and the other die
to be the ones place. It is recommended that the two dice are different colors,
or that one of them has explicit multiples-of-ten markings. Roll the dice. A
roll with 10 on both dice is considered 100.

Failure does not halt progress. Instead, it means a disadvantageous path to
progress.

**Example:** The Player-Characters are examining a scene for clues about what
really happened. Several of the Player-Characters are not currently using
relevant Jobs, so their chances to get clues are low. They have a variety of
options to get clues via other means:

-   Need to get more information from a shady broker. This then results in
    difficult sidequests.
-   Spend extra time to gather clues. But this gives the enemy enough time to
    bring a hit squad to the scene, who the party must then fight.
-   One of the characters must remember a painful and traumatic event, because
    that event was similar to the current scene under examination. They must
    literally fight against an enemy, solo, within their flashback.

**Example:** The Player-Characters are running away from an overwhelming enemy
force. One of the Player-Characters fails their Skill check. That character has
a variety of options that do not halt the story, but are certainly challenging:

-   Captured, has to fight solo through the enemy prison, but has an opportunity
    to steal some key documents on the way out.
-   Falls into a hole in the ground, has to fight solo through some special
    sewer enemies, but rejoins the rest of the party at the end.
-   The party stops to help the lost character. As a consequence, the enemy is
    able to bring out a powerful and challenging boss.

# Combat Rules

1.  Initiative Phase
2.  Movement And Actions Phase
3.  Status Phase

## Initiative Phase

Initiative Roll = 1d100 + Experience Level + Speed - Excess Weight

If you have leftover Charge Time and Cast Time from previous rounds, then you
pay those down with your Initiative. Extreme amounts of Charge Time and Cast
Time could result in effectively losing multiple turns.

## Movement And Actions Phase

**Charge Time:** Subtracted from your Initiative, then your action occurs at
your new Initiative. If this results in negative Initiative then you will carry
over the remaining Charge Time to the next round. Status conditions that would
prevent you from starting the action will also interrupt you and make you lose
the action.

**Cast Time:** Similar Charge Time, except that abilities with Cast Time have
the option of targeting either a unit or a position/square. If targeting a unit,
then even when that unit moves out of range during the Cast Time, the ability
still occurs, centered on that unit. If targeting a position/square, then even
if you move or are forcibly moved out of range during the Cast Time, the ability
still occurs, centered on that position/square.

### Movement

#### Mapless

You may spend Maneuver together with an Attack in order to aim at the target’s
Flank or Rear. It costs 2 Maneuver to aim at the Flank, and 4 Maneuver to aim at
the Rear.

Conversely, when you are being targeted, you can spend Maneuver to block such
attempts. It costs the same amount of Maneuver that the attacker spent to target
you: 2 Maneuver to stop an attempt at your Flank, and 4 Maneuver to stop an
attempt at your Rear. You can also spend 2 Maneuver to change a Rear attack
against you into merely a Flank attack.

You can also spend 3 Maneuver to move from your party’s front row to the back
row, or to move from back to front.

#### Map

You can choose to Move either before or after your Action.

Movement and range are determined by square-side-to-square-side. Movement
between corners is not possible. Each square of travel uses 1 horizontal
movement.

At the end of both your move and your action, you choose which square side to
face.

### Attack

| Accuracy               | Type of Hit         |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Double Evasion or more | Direct Critical Hit |
| 150% to Double Evasion | Direct Hit          |
| 75% to 150% Evasion    | Normal Hit          |
| Half to 75% Evasion    | Glancing Hit        |
| Half Evasion or less   | Miss                |

Example at 100 Evasion

| Evasion | Accuracy    | Type of Hit         |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| 100     | 200 or more | Direct Critical Hit |
| 100     | 150 to 199  | Direct Hit          |
| 100     | 75 to 149   | Normal Hit          |
| 100     | 50 to 74    | Glancing Hit        |
| 100     | 0 to 49     | Miss                |

Flank attacks ignore 25% of the target’s Eva. Rear attacks ignore half of the
target’s Eva.

Any ability that ignores Acc or Eva is automatically a *Normal Hit*.

-   **Direct Critical Hit:** Critical Hit, with a 10% chance to be a Devastating
    Hit. A Devastating Hit does triple After-Armor damage rather than double.
-   **Direct Hit:** 10% chance to be a Critical Hit. A Critical Hit does double
    After-Armor damage, and any harmful status effects of the attack have their
    durations increased by two status phases.
-   **Normal Hit:** Nothing special.
-   **Glancing Hit:** After-Armor damage is halved. Harmful status effects have
    their durations capped to 1 status phase, even if they normally do not have
    a finite duration. Instant-death is changed to an amount of damage equal to
    10% of the target’s maximum HP.
-   **Miss:** The attack has no effect on the target.

Doing any amount of damage from a regular Attack action restores an amount of TP
equal to your Determination.

Damage is resolved as follows:

1.  Calculate initial damage. Because no dice are involved, some of this can be
    pre-calculated. And without any other modifiers or status conditions in
    play, you may have this initial damage number already.
2.  Subtract the target’s armor - either P-Def or M-Def, according to the nature
    of the attack.
3.  Now you have the After-Armor Damage number. Subtract that from the target’s
    HP.

#### Gravity/Death Attacks

Gravity/Death attacks automatically have their Accuracy Class decreased by 1.
They are consequently unable to do Direct Critical Hits.

Plot Armor Enemies decrease the Accuracy Class by 1 more, so they cannot take
Direct Hits from Gravity/Death attacks. Furthermore, they halve all damage from
Gravity/Death attacks. Instant death is converted to an amount of damage equal
to 10% of maximum HP.

### Charge Up

Restores HP, MP and TP to yourself as follows:

-   HP restoration = Stamina
-   MP restoration = 1 + (Spirit \* 0.1)
-   TP restoration = Determination

### Defend

You enter a defensive stance until your next turn. Your P-Eva, P-Def, M-Eva, and
M-Def are all increased by 50% from your front.

### Item

Uses an item in order to apply its effect.

In map combat, you normally can only use an item on a square-side-adjacent

**Sight**

| Cost   |
|--------|
| MP: 10 |

Allows you to project your vision far into the sky, thus allowing you to see the
wider terrain. This vision lasts until you move or act, so some people just use
this spell as part of multiple-hour meditation in the same spot. The vision
projection cannot go through ceilings, making this spell less useful in
buildings and caverns.
